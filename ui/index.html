                <h1>Professional</h1>
                <p> I completed my B.E Computer Science from College of Engineering Guindy. I worked in Future Software, Chennai for a couple of years. Except for a bit of lesson plan development and simple animations in flash, I haven't really worked since then. I know that it may be tough but I am willing to put in all the effort that is required.</p>
                <p> I just want to prove it to myself that I still have it in me.</p>
