                    <p>  I am Susan Joseph and I am the mother of two wonderful kids. I was born and brought up in Kochi and am currently residing in Chennai. I am an easy going person with varied interests. Arts, crafts, baking, music, movies, reading ... the list just goes on. Infact I am discovering new interests along the way! </p>

                    <p> I am a Computer Science Engineer, but I opted to be a stay at home mom. My journey as a mother has taught me perseverence and patience. After a pretty long break I made an attempt at coding with this course. The going has had its share of up and downs, but the experience has been very fulfilling. A special thanks goes out to the entire IMAD team and my fellow learners who helped me everytime I fumbled.</p>
